# 2D Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) for Robot Path Planning
Author: Muye Jia

This RRT algorithm allows for 2D path planning for robots. The tree can find a free path around obstacles
with any shapes and sizes, and the path along with the Tree generated is visualized using Matplotlib.

## Example
The algorithm is going to plan a path around the Northwestern-N-shaped obstacle. Starting at (40, 40), ending at (60, 60).

The resulted path (plot in red):
